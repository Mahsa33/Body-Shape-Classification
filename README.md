# Body-Shape-Classification
**Deep Learning Empowering Women's Fashion with Grounded-Segment-Anything Segmentation for Body Shape Classification**
This repository provides a PyTorch implementation for classifying body shapes using image segmentation. The goal of this study is to classify body shapes into five categories: Rectangle, Triangle, Inverted Triangle, Hourglass, and Apple, using the Style4BodyShape dataset.

**Dataset**
The Style4BodyShape dataset is utilized in this project. It consists of images with annotated body shape segmentation masks. The segmentation masks extract the body shape of a person while disregarding the surroundings and background.

**Models**
Various pre-trained models are employed for the classification of the body shape segmentation results. The following models have been utilized:

ResNet18
ResNet34
ResNet50
VGG16
VGG19
Inception v3
